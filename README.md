# Ridge Regression Regularisation

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides a comprehensive guide on implementing ridge regression for regularisation in machine learning. The notebook covers the fundamentals of ridge regression, its implementation using Python, and a comparison with basic linear regression to evaluate its effectiveness.

## Notebook Contents

### 1. Introduction to Regularisation
- **Ridge Regression Formula**: \( \text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - (a + \sum_{j=1}^p b_j x_{ij}))^2 + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^p b_j^2 \)
- **Concept**: Discusses the need for regularisation to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the model's coefficients.

### 2. Getting Started
- **Import Libraries**: Utilises essential libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
- **Load Dataset**: Reads a dataset related to environmental and biodiversity metrics from an online source.
- **Initial Exploration**: Examines the dataset to understand its structure and the scales of different variables.

### 3. Data Preparation
- **Splitting Data**: Separates predictors and response variables.
- **Scaling Data**: Applies `StandardScaler` from `sklearn` to standardise the predictors.
- **Standardised Data**: Presents the scaled data to show the effect of standardisation.

### 4. Implementing Ridge Regression
- **Train/Test Split**: Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**: Trains a ridge regression model with a specified alpha value.
- **Model Coefficients**: Extracts and displays the intercept and coefficients of the trained ridge regression model.

### 5. Model Comparison
- **Basic Linear Regression**: Trains a simple linear regression model for comparison.
- **Training Accuracy**: Computes and compares the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for both models on the training data.
- **Testing Accuracy**: Computes and compares the MSE for both models on the testing data.
- **Prediction Plot**: Visualises the predicted and actual values for both training and testing data to assess the model performance.

## Example Data
- **Dataset**: Environmental and biodiversity metrics dataset.
- **Variables**: Includes metrics like WaterQualityIndex, ClimateChangeImpactScore, ConservationFunding, etc.
- **Exploration**: Demonstrates the variation in scales among different variables and the necessity for scaling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
